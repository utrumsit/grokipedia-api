# Grokipedia API
**Unofficial REST API for accessing full-text content and references from Grokipedia.com** (xAI's Wikipedia-inspired knowledge base with 5M+ articles). This API scrapes and caches pages for fast, developer-friendly access—ideal for AI tools, research apps, or data pipelines.

> **Disclaimer**: This is an unofficial, community-built tool. It is not affiliated with xAI or Grokipedia. Use responsibly and respect rate limits/terms of service. Grokipedia's structure may change, affecting reliability.

## Features

* References: Optional list of citation URLs (numbered).
* Caching: In-memory LRU cache (TTL: 2 days; max 1000 items) for performance.
* Rate Limiting: 100 requests/min per IP (generous for testing).
* Free & Open-Source: No API keys needed.

## API Endpoints
| Endpoint | Method | Description |Parameters | Response |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| /page/{slug} | GET | Fetch page by slug (e.g., "Elon_Musk").| Path: slug (str), Query: same as above | Page |
